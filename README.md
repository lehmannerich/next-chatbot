Thanks to [Mckay Wrigley](https://github.com/mckaywrigley) for his open source repos - I forked this as a starting point.

Thanks to the [Vercel Template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/ai-gpt3-chatbot) - I took a lot of code from it.

## Notes

This app isn't perfect - don't rely on it.

The behaviour with the input on mobile is a bit weird.
