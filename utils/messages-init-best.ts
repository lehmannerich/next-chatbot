You had trouble leaving the 'how am I supposed to do that' scenario and in which direction to go. I was a bit harder on you in this simulation. When you asked me 'how am I supposed to do that' I just told you how to do it. And you disregarded that. And then you asked me how to do it again. Now, if you asked me 'how' once and I told you, and you ask me again, unfortunately, what you just taught me is that you're not listening to me.\n\nOverall, you did a really nice job!",
